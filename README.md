# WASD_movement_edit
This project implements the WASD movment features in the sample code and extend the game play by creating another object that follows the player. 
The other object is known as an enemy and its visual features are a black square. It will contineously follow the player until contact is acheived.
It's speed is less than that of the player and nothing happens when it touches the player. But it will always seek the fastest route towards the player
